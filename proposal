Goal: To make an IRC bot that is capable of auto handling events

So far, I have decided I would like to incorperate a dice roll, as well

as a mini game to be played using the dice rolling mechanic. After this is

finished or in lue of its completion, I will begin making a chatbot that will

store statements made and replies made from them. Attempting to form unique  

replies.
